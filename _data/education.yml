    During my time at Guilan University I learnt lots of skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I was member of *Computer Scientific Association* for one year and I held several **Android workshops**.
