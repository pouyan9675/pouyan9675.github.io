excerpt: 'This research applies artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance the identification, classification, and analysis of clinical trials and drug development for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AI/ML models are used to automate the detection and extraction of clinical trials from clinicaltrials.gov, ensuring comprehensive and systematic coverage of ongoing research efforts. The Common Alzheimer’s Disease Research Ontology (CADRO) is leveraged to classify drug targets and mechanisms of action, providing a structured and data-driven approach to understanding treatment strategies. These methods improve the efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of clinical trial analysis, supporting the development of more effective therapies for AD.'
