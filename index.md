## About Me

I’m a final year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, with a passion for Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My work ranges from developing AI solutions for ancient handwritten documents to pioneering clinical trial summarization techniques. I love transforming complex challenges into intuitive, real-world solutions—and when I'm not immersed in research, I'm exploring the latest tech trends and innovative projects.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning:** deep learning, reinforcement learning, meta-learning, model quantization
- **Natural Language Processing:** language modeling, text summarization, clinical trial analysis, information extraction
